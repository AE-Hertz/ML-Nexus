# Hotel Demand Forecasting and Revenue Optimization

This project aims to forecast hotel demand for the next six months, providing key insights that can support room expansion planning, revenue optimization, and operational efficiency. By leveraging data analysis and in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project enables data-driven decision-making to improve overall resort operations.

## Project Overview

The primary goals of this project are:
1. **Demand Forecasting**: Predict future hotel demand to assist in planning for room expansion.
2. **Revenue Optimization**: Identify peak demand periods and opportunities for pricing adjustments to maximize revenue.
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Develop insights that streamline operations, minimize idle time, and optimize resource allocation.

## Key Features

- **6-Month Demand Forecast**: Accurate predictions of hotel demand to facilitate strategic planning.
- **In-Depth EDA**: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis to extract valuable insights.
- **Data-Driven Decision Support**: Actionable recommendations for maximizing occupancy and revenue while enhancing operational efficiency.

## Use Cases

1. **Room Expansion Planning**: Forecasts assist in decision-making around room availability and expansion based on projected occupancy rates.
2. **Revenue Optimization**: Leverage demand insights to adjust pricing and promotional strategies during peak and off-peak periods.
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Improve staff allocation, inventory management, and service readiness based on demand patterns.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels
- Other dependencies listed in `notebook`

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the hotel booking dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Run EDA scripts to generate insights and visualize data trends.
3. **Model Training**: Train forecasting models to predict hotel demand for the next 6 months.
4. **Forecast Visualization**: Visualize forecast results and analyze predicted demand trends.
5. **Report Generation**: Generate a summary report with actionable insights for revenue and operational improvement.

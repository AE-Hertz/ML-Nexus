# Time Series Analysis

## Overview

**Time Series Analysis** involves understanding patterns, trends, and structures within time-ordered data points. It has a wide range of applications including stock market analysis, weather forecasting, and more. This repository provides an introduction to time series analysis techniques, including data preparation, trend analysis, forecasting, and visualizations using Python libraries.

## Introduction

Time series analysis is essential for working with data that is collected over time. The goal is to understand historical trends and patterns in order to make predictions about the future. This project provides tools and examples to explore:

- Trend identification
- Seasonality
- Autoregressive models (AR)
- Moving Averages (MA)
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
- Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)
- Exponential Smoothing (ETS)

---

## Features

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Load time series data from CSV, Excel, or databases and handle missing data and outliers.
- **Trend & Seasonality Analysis**: Identify long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and random variations in your data.
- **Forecasting Models**: Implement predictive models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and Exponential Smoothing.
- **Visualization Tools**: Generate interactive time series plots for better insight into trends and forecasts.

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/timeseries-analysis.git
cd timeseries-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- seaborn

---

## Getting Started

To get started with time series analysis, follow the instructions below:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/timeseries-analysis.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Examples**:
    Navigate to the `examples/` folder to see ready-to-run Jupyter notebooks demonstrating time series analysis.

## Time Series Concepts

1. **Trend**: Long-term increase or decrease in the data.
2. **Seasonality**: Repeating short-term cycle in the data, often related to time of year or time of day.
3. **Stationarity**: A time series whose statistical properties such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation are constant over time.
4. **Autocorrelation**: The correlation of a time series with a lagged version of itself.
5. **Forecasting**: Predicting future data points based on historical patterns.

## Usage

### Data Preparation

Preprocessing your time series data is critical for effective analysis. Ensure that your data is in a time-ordered format and handle missing data appropriately.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('your_timeseries_data.csv', parse_dates=['date'], index_col='date')

# Check for missing values and handle them
data = data.fillna(method='ffill')

# Visualize the data
data.plot()
```

### Decomposition

Time series decomposition helps break down the data into its trend, seasonal, and residual components.

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose

result = seasonal_decompose(data['value'], model='additive')
result.plot()
```

### Forecasting

You can forecast future values using models like ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing.

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

# Build and fit the ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(data['value'], order=(5, 1, 0))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Forecast the next 10 steps
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=10)
print(forecast)
```

### Visualization

Visualize your time series and forecasts using Matplotlib or Seaborn.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the time series
data['value'].plot(label='Observed')
forecast.plot(label='Forecast', color='red')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## MUSIC RECOMMENDER SYSTEM

### ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**

The main goal of this project is to develop a music recommender system that suggests music tracks to users based on their preferences. The purpose is to enhance user experience by providing personalized music recommendations, thereby helping users discover new music that they might enjoy.

### ðŸ§® **What I had done!**

- Data Collection: Collected the music dataset, ensuring it includes relevant features such as track name, artist, genre, and popularity.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis by handling missing values and formatting issues.
- Feature Engineering: Combined multiple features (track name, artist, genre) into a single string to create a comprehensive feature set for similarity analysis.
- TF-IDF Vectorization: Converted text features into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to quantify the importance of each feature.
- Cosine Similarity Calculation: Implemented cosine similarity to measure the similarity between tracks based on their feature vectors.
- Recommendation System: Developed a function to generate recommendations based on user input, returning the top similar tracks.

### ðŸš€ **Models Implemented**

- Content-Based Filtering: This approach is used as it allows for personalized recommendations based on the characteristics of the items (tracks) rather than relying on user behavior. It works well in scenarios where user preferences are known and provides a straightforward way to suggest similar items.

### ðŸ“š **Libraries Needed**

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- scikit-learn: For implementing the TF-IDF vectorizer and calculating cosine similarity.
- numpy: For numerical operations.

# Object Detector
## Description
The Object Detector is a computer vision project that uses deep learning algorithms to detect and identify objects in images and videos. This project can be used for a variety of applications, such as security monitoring, autonomous vehicles, and smart home systems.

## Features

1.Supports detection of multiple object classes in a single image or video frame

2.Provides bounding boxes and class labels for each detected object

3.Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model for fast and accurate object detection

4.Allows for custom training of the object detection model on new datasets

5.Provides an easy-to-use Python API for integrating the object detector into your own projects

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.6 or higher

TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch 1.x

OpenCV

## Installation

1.Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/NANDAGOPALNG/ML-Nexus/tree/main/Generative%20Models/Object%20Detector

2.Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1.Import the object detector module:
python


from object_detector import ObjectDetector

2.Create an instance of the object detector:
python


detector = ObjectDetector()

3.Detect objects in an image:
python


image = cv2.imread('image.jpg')
detections = detector.detect(image)

4.Visualize the detected objects:
python


for detection in detections:

    x, y, w, h = detection['bbox']
    
    label = detection['label']
    
    cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (0, 255, 0), 2)
    
    cv2.putText(image, label, (x, y-10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (36,255,12), 2)
    
cv2.imshow('Object Detection', image)

cv2.waitKey(0)

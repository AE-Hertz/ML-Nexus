# RAG Chatbot
Most large language models can only provide information based on the corpus of data that theyâ€™ve been trained on.
These models might hallucinate if they don't have the required data or context.
This is where RAG or Retrieval-Augmented-Generation helps.

By incorporating a retriever, RAG pulls relevant information from external knowledge sources, such as databases or documents, to enrich the generated output with up-to-date, contextually accurate information. This approach helps to mitigate the limitations of static model training data, enabling real-time responses that adapt to the specific needs of each query.

The following technologies are used in making of this RAG based chatbot:

- sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-l6-v2 as sentence embedding model
- RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for chunking text
- Llama3.1 as the LLM
- FAISS as Vector DB

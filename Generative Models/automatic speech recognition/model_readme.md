Whisper is a state-of-the-art model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation, proposed in the paper Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision by Alec Radford et al. from OpenAI. Trained on >5M hours of labeled data, Whisper demonstrates a strong ability to generalise to many datasets and domains in a zero-shot setting.

Whisper large-v3-turbo is a finetuned version of a pruned Whisper large-v3. In other words, it's the exact same model, except that the number of decoding layers have reduced from 32 to 4. As a result, the model is way faster, at the expense of a minor quality degradation.

**Usage**
Whisper large-v3-turbo is supported in Hugging Face ü§ó Transformers. To run the model, first install the Transformers library. For this example, we'll also install ü§ó Datasets to load toy audio dataset from the Hugging Face Hub, and ü§ó Accelerate to reduce the model loading time:

```python
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade transformers datasets[audio] accelerate
```

The model can be used with the pipeline class to transcribe audios of arbitrary length:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq, AutoProcessor, pipeline
from datasets import load_dataset


device = "cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
torch_dtype = torch.float16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32

model_id = "openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo"

model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(
    model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True
)
model.to(device)

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)

pipe = pipeline(
    "automatic-speech-recognition",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=processor.tokenizer,
    feature_extractor=processor.feature_extractor,
    torch_dtype=torch_dtype,
    device=device,
)

dataset = load_dataset("distil-whisper/librispeech_long", "clean", split="validation")
sample = dataset[0]["audio"]

result = pipe(sample)
print(result["text"])
```

To transcribe a local audio file, simply pass the path to your audio file when you call the pipeline:

```python
result = pipe("audio.mp3")
```

Multiple audio files can be transcribed in parallel by specifying them as a list and setting the batch_size parameter:

```python
result = pipe(["audio_1.mp3", "audio_2.mp3"], batch_size=2)
```

Transformers is compatible with all Whisper decoding strategies, such as temperature fallback and condition on previous tokens. The following example demonstrates how to enable these heuristics:

```python
generate_kwargs = {
    "max_new_tokens": 448,
    "num_beams": 1,
    "condition_on_prev_tokens": False,
    "compression_ratio_threshold": 1.35,  # zlib compression ratio threshold (in token space)
    "temperature": (0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0),
    "logprob_threshold": -1.0,
    "no_speech_threshold": 0.6,
    "return_timestamps": True,
}

```
```python
result = pipe(sample, generate_kwargs=generate_kwargs)
```

Whisper predicts the language of the source audio automatically. If the source audio language is known a-priori, it can be passed as an argument to the pipeline:

```python
result = pipe(sample, generate_kwargs={"language": "english"})
```

By default, Whisper performs the task of speech transcription, where the source audio language is the same as the target text language. To perform speech translation, where the target text is in English, set the task to "translate":

```python
result = pipe(sample, generate_kwargs={"task": "translate"})
```

Finally, the model can be made to predict timestamps. For sentence-level timestamps, pass the return_timestamps argument:

```python
result = pipe(sample, return_timestamps=True)
print(result["chunks"])
```

And for word-level timestamps:

```python
result = pipe(sample, return_timestamps="word")
print(result["chunks"])
```

The above arguments can be used in isolation or in combination. For example, to perform the task of speech transcription where the source audio is in French, and we want to return sentence-level timestamps, the following can be used:

```python
result = pipe(sample, return_timestamps=True, generate_kwargs={"language": "french", "task": "translate"})
print(result["chunks"])
```

For more control over the generation parameters, use the model + processor API directly:
Additional Speed & Memory Improvements
You can apply additional speed and memory improvements to Whisper to further reduce the inference speed and VRAM requirements.

**Chunked Long-Form**
Whisper has a receptive field of 30-seconds. To transcribe audios longer than this, one of two long-form algorithms are required:

Sequential: uses a "sliding window" for buffered inference, transcribing 30-second slices one after the other
Chunked: splits long audio files into shorter ones (with a small overlap between segments), transcribes each segment independently, and stitches the resulting transcriptions at the boundaries
The sequential long-form algorithm should be used in either of the following scenarios:

Transcription accuracy is the most important factor, and speed is less of a consideration
You are transcribing batches of long audio files, in which case the latency of sequential is comparable to chunked, while being up to 0.5% WER more accurate
Conversely, the chunked algorithm should be used when:

Transcription speed is the most important factor
You are transcribing a single long audio file
By default, Transformers uses the sequential algorithm. To enable the chunked algorithm, pass the chunk_length_s parameter to the pipeline. For large-v3, a chunk length of 30-seconds is optimal. To activate batching over long audio files, pass the argument batch_size:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq, AutoProcessor, pipeline
from datasets import load_dataset


device = "cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
torch_dtype = torch.float16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32

model_id = "openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo"

model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(
    model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True
)
model.to(device)

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)

pipe = pipeline(
    "automatic-speech-recognition",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=processor.tokenizer,
    feature_extractor=processor.feature_extractor,
    chunk_length_s=30,
    batch_size=16,  # batch size for inference - set based on your device
    torch_dtype=torch_dtype,
    device=device,
)

dataset = load_dataset("distil-whisper/librispeech_long", "clean", split="validation")
sample = dataset[0]["audio"]

result = pipe(sample)
print(result["text"])
```

Torch compile
The Whisper forward pass is compatible with torch.compile for 4.5x speed-ups.

Note: torch.compile is currently not compatible with the Chunked long-form algorithm or Flash Attention 2 ‚ö†Ô∏è

```python
import torch
from torch.nn.attention import SDPBackend, sdpa_kernel
from transformers import AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq, AutoProcessor, pipeline
from datasets import load_dataset
from tqdm import tqdm

torch.set_float32_matmul_precision("high")

device = "cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
torch_dtype = torch.float16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32

model_id = "openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo"

model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(
    model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True
).to(device)

# Enable static cache and compile the forward pass
model.generation_config.cache_implementation = "static"
model.generation_config.max_new_tokens = 256
model.forward = torch.compile(model.forward, mode="reduce-overhead", fullgraph=True)

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)

pipe = pipeline(
    "automatic-speech-recognition",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=processor.tokenizer,
    feature_extractor=processor.feature_extractor,
    torch_dtype=torch_dtype,
    device=device,
)

dataset = load_dataset("distil-whisper/librispeech_long", "clean", split="validation")
sample = dataset[0]["audio"]

# 2 warmup steps
for _ in tqdm(range(2), desc="Warm-up step"):
    with sdpa_kernel(SDPBackend.MATH):
        result = pipe(sample.copy(), generate_kwargs={"min_new_tokens": 256, "max_new_tokens": 256})

# fast run
with sdpa_kernel(SDPBackend.MATH):
    result = pipe(sample.copy())

print(result["text"])
```

Flash Attention 2
We recommend using Flash-Attention 2 if your GPU supports it and you are not using torch.compile. To do so, first install Flash Attention:

```python
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

Then pass attn_implementation="flash_attention_2" to from_pretrained:

model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, attn_implementation="flash_attention_2")

Torch Scale-Product-Attention (SDPA)
If your GPU does not support Flash Attention, we recommend making use of PyTorch scaled dot-product attention (SDPA). This attention implementation is activated by default for PyTorch versions 2.1.1 or greater. To check whether you have a compatible PyTorch version, run the following Python code snippet:

```python
from transformers.utils import is_torch_sdpa_available

print(is_torch_sdpa_available())
```

If the above returns True, you have a valid version of PyTorch installed and SDPA is activated by default. If it returns False, you need to upgrade your PyTorch version according to the official instructions

Once a valid PyTorch version is installed, SDPA is activated by default. It can also be set explicitly by specifying attn_implementation="sdpa" as follows:

```python
model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype
```

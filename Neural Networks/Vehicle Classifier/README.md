# Vehicle Classifier AI

## Description

- Developed a high-performance **Vehicle Image Recognizer** web app using **deep learning techniques**.
- Designed and implemented a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to classify various vehicle types.
- Integrated a **Flask** server for backend functionality, allowing users to upload vehicle images and receive real-time predictions.
- Supports recognition of vehicles including **bus, family sedan, fire engine, heavy truck, jeep, minibus, racing car, SUV, taxi, and truck**.

## Features

- **Real-Time Predictions:** Utilized Flask to manage image uploads and provide on-the-fly predictions for the type of vehicle.
- **Interactive Web App:** Designed an intuitive web interface where users can easily upload images and get immediate classification results.
- **Highly Accurate Model:** Trained the CNN on a dataset of 1,400 images for training and 200 images for validation, leading to a highly performant model.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Web Framework:** Flask
- **Frontend Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Dataset:** 
  - Vehicle classification dataset from Kaggle: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marquis03/vehicle-classification)

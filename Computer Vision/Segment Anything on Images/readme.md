# Segment Anything on Images

This repository contains an implementation of Meta AI's **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** for image segmentation. SAM is a powerful model that can segment objects in images without requiring specific knowledge about the object classes. It is designed to generalize across different object types and segmentation tasks.

## Overview

The **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** allows for **interactive image segmentation** by using various types of prompts (such as points, bounding boxes, or clicks). This repository demonstrates how SAM can be applied to images for object segmentation.

### Key Features
- **Pre-trained SAM model**: Leverages Meta AI's pre-trained SAM for state-of-the-art segmentation results.
- **Interactive prompts**: Users can guide the model by providing points, bounding boxes, or other prompts to improve segmentation accuracy.
- **Automatic segmentation**: The model can automatically identify and segment objects in images.
- **Segmentation visualization**: Displays segmented areas on images, highlighting identified objects.

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaidh01/ML-Nexus.git
cd ML-Nexus/Computer\ Vision/Segment\ Anything\ on\ Images/
```

### 2. Open the Notebook
You can run the notebook directly in Google Colab or locally on your system.

- **Google Colab**: Open the notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jaidh01/ML-Nexus/blob/fix-issue-484/Computer%20Vision/Segment%20Anything%20on%20Images/Segment_Anything_in_images.ipynb)
- **Local Setup**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (see below).

### 3. Install Dependencies
If running locally, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Notebook
Once dependencies are installed, open the notebook using Jupyter or Colab, and run the cells to start using SAM for image segmentation.

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: Users upload an image or use sample images.
2. **Prompt Input**: Provide interactive prompts (like clicking on points) to guide the model.
3. **Segmentation**: The model segments the objects in the image based on the provided prompts.
4. **Visualization**: The segmented image is displayed with object boundaries overlaid.

## Results

The model generates segmented images where detected objects are marked with clear boundaries. You can experiment with various images and prompts to see how well SAM generalizes to different objects.

## Applications

- **Object detection**: Identify and segment objects in diverse images.
- **Scene understanding**: Break down complex scenes into identifiable components.
- **Medical imaging**: Use SAM for segmenting areas in medical scans or images.
- **Autonomous driving**: Segment objects in driving scenarios, such as pedestrians or vehicles.

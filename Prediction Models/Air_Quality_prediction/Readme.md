## Problem Statement

Air quality significantly impacts public health, and accurate forecasting allows for timely interventions. However, due to various influencing factors, air quality prediction requires complex modeling. This project leverages an LSTM model to predict future air quality levels based on historical data, addressing the need for a reliable forecasting tool.

## Project Overview

This project applies a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to:
1. Learn from temporal patterns in historical air quality data.
2. Forecast future air quality levels, assisting in monitoring and policy-making.

The model provides insights into future pollution levels, helping to mitigate adverse effects on the environment and public health.

## Model Architecture

The LSTM model architecture consists of:
- **Input Layer**: Processes sequential data from historical air quality measurements.
- **LSTM Layers**: Captures long-term dependencies in data, essential for accurate forecasting.
- **Dense Layer**: Outputs the forecasted air quality level.

## Dataset

The dataset includes time-series air quality measurements with features such as pollutant concentration, temperature, humidity, and other meteorological indicators. Each data point represents an air quality measurement over time.

## Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps:
1. **Normalization**: Scales features to ensure consistency.
2. **Sequence Generation**: Creates sequences of historical data to train the LSTM model.
3. **Splitting**: Divides data into training, validation, and test sets.

## Training and Evaluation

- **Training**: The model is trained on historical air quality data, optimizing for Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as MSE and MAE to assess prediction accuracy.

## Results

The model achieves competitive results in predicting air quality, accurately capturing patterns over time. Performance metrics include:
- **MSE**: Measures average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- **MAE**: Measures average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.

# Kidney Stone Prediction using Neural Networks and EDA

This repository contains a neural network-based model designed to predict the likelihood of kidney stone disease. By analyzing a dataset of patient medical records, the project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover significant patterns, which inform the predictive model.

## Problem Statement

Kidney stones can lead to severe health issues if not identified early. Traditional diagnostic methods may not always predict stone formation effectively. This project aims to create a neural network model that, informed by patterns identified through EDA, can accurately predict kidney stone disease based on medical data.

## Project Overview

This project involves:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding and visualizing the dataset to identify key features related to kidney stone risk.
2. **Model Development**: Building a neural network model to predict kidney stone disease.
3. **Evaluation**: Testing the modelâ€™s accuracy and reliability on unseen data.

The model leverages various health indicators from patient records, aiming to provide a robust tool for kidney stone prediction.

## EDA and Model Development

The project consists of two primary stages:
- **EDA**: Initial data exploration to find correlations and patterns relevant to kidney stone disease.
- **Neural Network Model**: A multi-layer neural network to learn from the dataset and make predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset contains medical records with various health indicators, such as patient demographics and lab results, which are relevant to kidney stone formation. Each entry is labeled with a diagnosis indicating kidney stone presence or absence.

## Preprocessing

Data preprocessing includes:
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Imputing or removing missing entries as appropriate.
2. **Normalization**: Scaling features to ensure consistency.
3. **Splitting**: Dividing data into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Training and Evaluation

- **Training**: The model is trained on labeled data using a binary cross-entropy loss function.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate model performance.

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy in predicting kidney stones. Evaluation metrics demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying high-risk patients based on the dataset.

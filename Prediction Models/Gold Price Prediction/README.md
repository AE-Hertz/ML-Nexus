# Gold Price Prediction using Random Forest

This project predicts gold prices based on historical data using a **Random Forest Regressor**. The goal is to provide accurate price forecasts to assist investors and businesses in making informed financial decisions. 

## Project Overview

- **Algorithm Used**: Random Forest Regressor  
- **Model Performance**:  
  - **R² Score**: 0.9898  
- **Objective**: Forecast future gold prices based on historical data trends.  
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Features

- Predict future gold prices with high accuracy.  
- Visualize trends and patterns in historical data.  
- Provide insights to assist in financial planning and risk management.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd gold-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Project_6_Gold_Price_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

- Load the historical dataset (e.g., daily gold prices).  
- Train the Random Forest model on the dataset.  
- Predict future prices and evaluate the model using **R² Score**.
- Use the visualizations to analyze trends.

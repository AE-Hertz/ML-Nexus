## Introduction

Determining the age of marine species such as crabs is essential for studying population dynamics and ecological impacts. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict crab age based on various biological characteristics, like size, weight, and shell dimensions. The model aims to help biologists and ecologists with accurate age estimations, facilitating better research and conservation efforts.

## Problem Statement

Age prediction in crabs is complex due to several challenges:
- **Biological Variability**: Differences in growth rates across individual crabs due to genetics and environmental factors.
- **Measurement Limitations**: Variability in available biological measurements.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying which measurements contribute most effectively to accurate age prediction.

This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging machine learning techniques to create a predictive model for crab age.

## Solution Overview

The model uses various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods. Steps taken include:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns, outliers, and relationships within the data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and transforming features to improve model accuracy.
3. **Model Selection and Training**: Comparing multiple models to determine the best predictor of crab age.
  
Key features may include measurements such as carapace length, width, weight, and other morphological characteristics.

## Data

The dataset contains various biological measurements for crabs, including:
- **Carapace Dimensions**: Length, width, and height.
- **Weight Measurements**: Including whole weight, shell weight, etc.
- **Other Characteristics**: Information about species, habitat, or other ecological factors, if available.

The dataset should be placed in the `data/` folder in CSV format.

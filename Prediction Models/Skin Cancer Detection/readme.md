# Skin Cancer Detection

This project focuses on detecting skin cancer using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on images of skin lesions. The aim is to classify skin lesions into two categories: benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous), which can help in the early detection of skin cancer and potentially save lives.

## üìã Problem Description

Skin cancer is a prevalent form of cancer, and early detection can significantly increase the chances of successful treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods can be costly and may not always catch early signs. This project aims to automate the detection of skin cancer from dermoscopic images, providing a quick and reliable diagnosis.

## üß† Model Overview

The model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is well-suited for image classification tasks. The architecture includes layers for convolution, pooling, and fully-connected neural networks, enabling the model to learn important features from the images and classify them into either benign or malignant.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used contains labeled images of skin lesions, categorized as benign or malignant. Each image is preprocessed to a standard size suitable for input to the model (e.g., 128x128 pixels).

### Data Preparation:
- **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like rotation, zoom, and horizontal flipping are used to increase the diversity of the training data.
- **Splitting:** The data is split into training and validation sets to assess the model's performance.

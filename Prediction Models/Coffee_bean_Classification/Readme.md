# Coffee Bean Classification with Deep Learning

This project leverages deep learning to classify coffee bean types based on visual features. By training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on labeled coffee bean images, we aim to create a system capable of identifying different types of coffee beans automatically.

## Introduction

This project focuses on image classification using deep learning techniques to differentiate between various coffee bean types. This is particularly useful in industries that require high-quality control and consistent coffee bean quality.

## Dataset
The dataset contains images of coffee beans from different types. These images are preprocessed for uniformity, and are then split into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Model
We implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image classification. Key layers include:

- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Pooling layers to reduce dimensionality
- Dense layers to classify images based on extracted features

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test dataset. The model achieves satisfactory results in distinguishing between coffee bean types.

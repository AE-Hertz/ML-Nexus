## Methodology
- Data Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and the 'classification' column is mapped to binary values (0 for benign, 1 for malware). The data is then shuffled.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: The distribution of the target variable ('classification') is visualized. A correlation matrix is generated to identify relationships between features.

- Feature Selection: Several features are dropped based on low correlation or redundancy.

- Data Normalization: The data is normalized using StandardScaler to standardize the range of features.

- Model Building: A deep neural network is constructed using TensorFlow/Keras. The model consists of multiple dense layers with ReLU activation functions and an output layer with a softmax activation function.

- Model Compilation and Training: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function. It is trained on the training data with a specified batch size and number of epochs. ¬† 

- Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the test data, and the test loss and accuracy are printed.

- Fine-tuning: The model is further trained using an SGD optimizer with a lower learning rate and early stopping to potentially improve performance.

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy (over 99%) in classifying malware on the test data. The training history is visualized to observe the trend of accuracy and loss over epochs.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in malware detection. By analyzing behavioral patterns, the model can identify malicious applications with high accuracy, contributing to improved security on Android devices.

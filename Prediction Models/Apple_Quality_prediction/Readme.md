# Apple Quality Prediction Model

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a classification model to predict the quality of apples based on a variety of physical and chemical features. The dataset includes features like size, weight, sweetness, crunchiness, juiciness, ripeness, and acidity. The target variable, `Quality`, labels apples as either "good" or "bad." By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to create a model that accurately classifies apple quality, helping to streamline the quality assessment process in the agricultural industry.

## Problem Statement

Determining the quality of apples traditionally relies on manual inspection, which can be time-consuming and subjective. This project aims to automate the apple quality classification process using machine learning, providing an efficient and reliable solution for quality control in fruit production and supply chains.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains:
- **Features:** Size, Weight, Sweetness, Crunchiness, Juiciness, Ripeness, Acidity
- **Target:** Quality (Good, Bad)

The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.

## Model Selection and Evaluation

Several models are trained and evaluated to determine the best-performing classifier:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**
3. **Random Forest Classifier**
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
6. **Neural Network**
7. **XGBoost**

Each model's performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy and F1 score, with cross-validation for enhanced reliability.

## Results

- The **Neural Network** and **Random Forest** models achieved the highest accuracy and F1 scores, indicating their capability to handle the data's complexity.
- Other models, like SVM and XGBoost, also performed well, demonstrating robustness across various machine learning techniques.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE



## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning models in automating quality assessment in agriculture. The findings show that specific models, such as Neural Networks and Random Forests, can provide reliable predictions, making them suitable for real-world applications in quality control.

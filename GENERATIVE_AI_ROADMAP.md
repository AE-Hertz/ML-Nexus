<h1 align="center"><b>Generative AI Roadmap</b></h1>

Generative AI is a subset of Artificial Intelligence where content we required is **Generated** with the help of **Prompts.**

**prompts:** Prompts are the piece of text where we need to give to AI, To generate more content.

### **Types of prompts:**
- **System Prompt:** System prompts are used to add text in the programming languages, where it won't change again and again. We can insert User prompt into system prompt in some cases.
- **User Prompt:** User prompts are used to add text from the user to AI.

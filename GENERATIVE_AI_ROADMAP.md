# **Generative AI Roadmap**

Generative AI is a subset of Artificial Intelligence where content we required is **Generated** with the help of **Prompts.**

**prompts:** Prompts are the piece of text where we need to give to AI, To generate more content.

### **Types of prompts:**
- **System Prompt:** System prompts are used to add text in the programming languages, where it won't change again and again. We can insert User prompt into system prompt in some cases.
- **User Prompt:** User prompts are used to add text from the user to AI.


### _**Python libraries to learn Generative AI**_

  #### **1. Langchain ü¶ú**
  
  - LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of applications that utilize large language models (LLMs).
  - LangChain enables developers to combine powerful LLMs, such as those from OpenAI (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4), with external data sources and other components to build robust NLP applications.
  - It provides a standardized interface for interacting with various LLMs and integrating them with different data sources and software workflows.
  
  #### **2. LangSmith ü¶úüõ†Ô∏è**
  
  - LangSmith is a comprehensive platform designed to support the development, deployment, and maintenance of Large Language Model (LLM) applications, particularly focusing on the transition from prototyping to production.

### _**Large Language Models (LLMs)**_

- A Large Language Model (LLM) is a sophisticated type of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to process, understand, and generate human language.
- LLMs are deep learning algorithms that use massive datasets to recognize, generate, translate, and summarize vast quantities of written human language. They are a subset of machine learning, specifically within the domain of natural language processing (NLP).

### _**Various types of Large Language Models**_

  ### 1. For text generation

  - **ChatGPT:** ChatGPT is based on the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architecture, specifically using the GPT-3.5 and later updated to GPT-4 models. These models are trained on massive datasets, approximately 45 terabytes of text from the internet, to learn patterns and associations in language.
  - **Google Gemini:** Google Gemini is designed to be multimodal, meaning it can seamlessly understand, process, and generate various types of data, including text, code, images, audio, and video. This multimodality allows Gemini to perform a wide range of tasks across different domains.
  - **Claude:** Claude is trained to engage in natural, text-based conversations and excels in tasks such as summarization, editing, Q&A, decision-making, and code writing. As of Claude 3, the model can also analyze and transcribe static images, including handwritten notes and photographs.
  - **Llama:** Llama, which stands for Large Language Model Meta AI, is a family of autoregressive large language models developed by Meta AI. Which is free and open source LLM and can run locally.
  - **Mistral:** Mistral AI is a French company specializing in the development and deployment of advanced artificial intelligence, particularly large language models. his model uses a sparse mixture of experts architecture, with 46.7 billion parameters but only using 12.9 billion parameters per token. It beats benchmarks set by LLaMA 70B and GPT-3.5 in many tests.

  ### 2. For image generation

# Parkinson's Disease Classification using SVM  

## **Overview**  
This feature implements **Parkinson's Disease Classification** using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm as part of the **ML Nexus project for GSSoC '24**. Parkinson’s is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and speech, with early detection playing a crucial role in managing symptoms and improving outcomes. The goal of this feature is to create a model capable of accurately identifying individuals with Parkinson's Disease using data such as vocal patterns, motor functions, and tremor measurements.

## **Why SVM for Parkinson's Detection?**  
SVM is particularly well-suited for this task because:  
- It can handle **small datasets** effectively.  
- It performs well in **high-dimensional feature spaces**.  
- It ensures better generalization by finding an optimal decision boundary between classes.

## **Project Impact**  
Adding this feature to ML Nexus will:  
1. **Extend the project's impact** into healthcare, demonstrating real-world applications of machine learning.  
2. Provide **contributors with hands-on experience** in building machine learning models for medical diagnosis.  
3. Empower users with **an early detection tool** that can assist healthcare providers in managing Parkinson's Disease more effectively.

## **Dataset & Features**  
The model uses features such as:  
- **Vocal Patterns** (e.g., jitter, shimmer)  
- **Motor Function Data** (e.g., hand tremors, muscle stiffness)  
- **Tremor Data** (frequency and intensity of tremors)

## **Performance Metrics**  
The model’s accuracy demonstrates its reliability:  
- **Training Data Accuracy**: 88.46%  
- **Test Data Accuracy**: 87.18%  

These metrics suggest the model performs consistently well on both seen and unseen data, making it a reliable tool for detecting Parkinson’s Disease.
